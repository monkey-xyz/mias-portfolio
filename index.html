            <article>
                <p>Armed with only a high school diploma, I graduated from online school in 2020 and went directly into working in retail the following year. With a lack of experience, I wanted to get used to fast-paced and demanding environments through one of the most hands-on ways. My history makes me very adept at adapting to changes and other suggestions that can stump other people.</p>

                <p>I grew up on the internet, I've been on the computer since I was a toddler in the mid-2000s to where I am now in the current year. I started playing around with inspect element here and there in middle school, editing preexisting tumblr themes, and in my last few years of high school developed static, Geocities-esque pages for fun. Now I want to learn more, past what I had initially done with little insight.</p>
