# My Portfolio

Our first experience for the second week coding a site from scratch, in particular this time being a portfolio that we can show our works through. This site was developed with the intent to be able to showcase a variety of projects we've worked on throughout the year and provide a description of the user.

## About the Project

[My Portfolio](https://pldbrja.github.io/mias-portfolio/)

This portfolio is a static page, section navigation is handled through a list with links rather than with button press. The navigation is located to the top right on a desktop screen beside the name, which shifts to below the first heading on mobile / smaller screens. An image is placed underneath the header to separate the main content of the portfolio.

All special effects applied on hover were handled through CSS transitions by use of the :hover selector on specific elements, rather than just applying them to every single piece of the page.

UPDATE (4/15/22) - The placeholder projects have been replaced by images and links to homework / projects from class. Although stock images are no longer used, the credits at the bottom of the README will be kept in.
