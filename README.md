# My Portfolio

Our first experience for the second week coding a site from scratch, in particular this time being a portfolio that we can show our works through.

## About the Project

[My Portfolio](https://pldbrja.github.io/mias-portfolio/)

Making this portfolio was much harder when trying to keep it to the general modern idea of what a portfolio would look like. It had to be able to host the personal information of the user, and include a few select works that could be updated easily or added to in the future.

As a result of this, I had initially had a Y2K-ish one where I did not attempt to bend too many visual features. After getting around halfway through, I chose to drop it in order to pursue something that was a bit more put together.

Linear and easy to follow, but with an assortment of hover effects to enhance the feel of the page.
