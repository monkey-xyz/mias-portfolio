# My Portfolio

Our first experience for the second week coding a site from scratch, in particular this time being a portfolio that we can show our work through.

## Information

Making this portfolio was much harder when trying to keep it to the general modern idea of what a portfolio would look like. It was a struggle, as I wanted to keep an aspect of it unique but without having it be too much of an annoyance to look at and browse through for grading. As a result of this, I had initially had a Y2K-esque one where I did not attempt to bend too many visual features. After getting around halfway through, I chose to drop it in order to pursue something that was a bit more put together. The repository where it was saved is still online, but I will not be submitting it.

The older code is archived and without a page, but the repository is linked below.

## Status

This is a temporary thing, I'll be removing this once I get further into developing this.
